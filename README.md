# Roads Webapp

This is a simple Node.js/Express web application with an SQLite database for managing items. Each item consists of:

- **Category**
- **Description**
- **Unit of measurement**
- **Cost per unit**

The main page allows you to add items and shows the last five entries. A second page at `/report` lets you build damage reports. At the top of each report you can enter the supervisor name, police report number, street, state, and a short location description. Choose a category, enter quantities for items and press **Add Items** to build up your report. When finished, click **Save Report** to store it or **Discard Report** to clear the form. Each saved report shows the total cost of its items. Use the **Download PDF** button to export a nicely formatted report with your header information and an itemized table.

   ```bash
