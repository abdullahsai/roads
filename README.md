# Roads Webapp

This is a simple Node.js/Express web application with an SQLite database for managing items. The interface is now in Arabic and uses a right-to-left layout. Each item consists of:

- **Category**
- **Description**
- **Unit of measurement**
- **Cost per unit**

The main page allows you to add items and shows the last five entries. A second page at `/report` lets you build damage reports. At the top of each report you can enter the supervisor name, police report number, street, state, and a short location description. Choose a category, enter quantities for items and press **Add Items** to build up your report. When finished, click **Save Report** to store it or **Discard Report** to clear the form. Each saved report shows the total cost of its items. Use the **Download PDF** button to export a nicely formatted report with your header information and an itemized table.

The repository includes placeholder files at `public/amiri.ttf` and `public/logo.png`. Before exporting PDFs, download the real Amiri font from the [official releases](https://github.com/aliftype/amiri/releases) and place your 333 × 333 PNG logo in these paths, replacing the placeholders.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Node.js 18 or newer is recommended.
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
The app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

On the report page you can capture your current location with GPS. Click
**الحصول على الموقع** and wait for the indicator to turn green, then press
**إضافة الإحداثيات** to attach your coordinates (stored as Google Plus Codes)
to the report. After adding, the Plus Code is shown below the button and will
also appear in the generated PDF beneath the location description.

## Docker

Build and run using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t roads-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 roads-app
